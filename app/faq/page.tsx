              <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Q: Is SnapFAI free to use?</h3>
              <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, SnapFAI is completely free to use. You only pay standard blockchain gas fees for transactions, which go directly to the network validators and miners. We don't charge any additional fees or subscriptions.</p>

              <p><strong>A:</strong> No, SnapFAI is completely non-custodial. We never have access to your private keys or funds. All transactions are signed directly by your wallet, and you maintain full control of your assets at all times.</p>

              <p><strong>A:</strong> SnapFAI supports all major Web3 wallets including MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, and embedded social wallets. Any wallet that supports the networks we operate on will work with SnapFAI.</p>

              <p><strong>A:</strong> SnapFAI is the first AI-powered DeFi platform that allows you to interact with blockchain protocols using natural language. Instead of navigating complex interfaces, you simply chat with our AI to execute trades, check prices, and get market insights.</p>

            <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Q: How do you find the best prices?</h3>
              <p><strong>A:</strong> SnapFAI aggregates prices from multiple DEX protocols through 0x Protocol integration to find optimal rates. We automatically scan across different liquidity sources and present you with the best available price for your trade.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Q: What is slippage protection?</h3>
              <p><strong>A:</strong> Slippage protection ensures your trade executes within acceptable price ranges. We default to 1% slippage tolerance, but you can customize this. If the price moves unfavorably beyond your tolerance, the transaction will fail to protect you from unexpected losses.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Q: Can I cancel a transaction?</h3>
              <p><strong>A:</strong> Once a transaction is submitted to the blockchain, it cannot be cancelled. However, you can set appropriate gas fees for faster processing, and our interface will warn you before confirming any transaction.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Q: What's the minimum trade amount?</h3>
              <p><strong>A:</strong> There's no minimum trade amount imposed by SnapFAI, but you should consider gas fees and ensure the trade amount makes economic sense. Very small trades might not be cost-effective due to blockchain transaction fees.</p>

              <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Q: How accurate are the price quotes?</h3>
              <p><strong>A:</strong> Price quotes are real-time and accurate at the moment of request. However, prices can change rapidly due to market volatility. We refresh quotes regularly and warn you if prices have moved significantly before transaction confirmation.</p>

              <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Q: What happens if a transaction fails?</h3>
              <p><strong>A:</strong> If a transaction fails, SnapFAI analyzes the failure reason and provides clear explanations with actionable guidance. Common reasons include insufficient gas, price slippage, or network congestion. You'll still pay gas fees for failed transactions as this goes to network validators.</p>

              <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, we prioritize user privacy and only process data necessary for service functionality. We don't store personal information unnecessarily and never share user data with third parties. All communication is encrypted and secure.</p>

              <p><strong>A:</strong> Try refreshing the page, clearing your browser cache, or switching to a different browser. Ensure your wallet is unlocked and on the correct network. If issues persist, check if your wallet needs updating or contact support.</p>

              <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Q: Why is my transaction taking so long?</h3>
              <p><strong>A:</strong> Transaction speed depends on network congestion and gas fees paid. Higher gas fees result in faster processing. During busy periods, transactions may take longer. You can check transaction status on blockchain explorers using the transaction hash.</p>

              <p><strong>A:</strong> Try being more specific with amounts, token names, and networks. Use our common prompt examples as a guide. If the AI still doesn't understand, you can contact support or try rephrasing your request in simpler terms.</p>
